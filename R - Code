Explanation of Hypothesis testing:

The p-value is larger than the typical threshold of 0.05 the difference is highly insignificant, 
so we can't reject the null hypothesis. In other words the results are due to chance. However, A/B testing is not a one-time job. 
It must be done continually with an automated process and re-check the outcome.
